Hi! My name is Jack Gaskins and this shall be where I document my ideas and creations.

My hope is that by documenting my projects, I can refer by to paradigms that helped me solve a problem and, by proxy, I hope some of my solutions can solve your problems, too.

Day 1 of this site is 01/17/2026.

The pages I plan to start with are:

- Iteractive Resume
- My Development Setup
- Goals for 2026
- Revisiting Old Failures

Stay tuned for updates!
